# RT Papers' Implementation

### Finding the right regression testing method: a taxonomy-based approach
This repository was created as a supplement to the article entitled *"Finding the right regression testing method: a taxonomy-based approach"*. We make our implementations available to help disseminate the methods proposed in the literature and to gather feedback from the scientific community on their interpretation.

#### Abstract
> The optimization of regression testing (RT) has been widely studied in the literature, and numerous methods exist. However, each context is unique. Therefore, a key challenge emerges: how to tell which method is more suitable for a specific industrial context? Recent work has proposed a taxonomy to help answer this question. By mapping both the RT problem and existing solutions onto the taxonomy, practitioners should be able to determine the solutions best aligned with their problem. Our work explores the practical relevance of this idea through an industrial case study.  The context is the development of R\&D projects at a major automotive company, in the domain of connected vehicles.  We developed an RT problem solving approach that uses the knowledge captured by the taxonomy. Following the approach, we characterized the RT problem and identified a set of 8 potentially relevant solutions from a set of 52 papers.   One of them stood out in the empirical evaluation, and could therefore be recommended to the industrial company. However, this success came at the cost of difficulties due to unclear taxonomy elements, missing ones, and  paper classification errors.  We conclude that the taxonomy would have to mature.
